# Pyton 3.8 - Pawn Compiler.
Compiler for **Pawn** using Python 3.8. 
Compiler keeps track of **localtime**, and **build number**. 
Additional libraries aren't required.

# How to use?
First, make sure that you have Phyton 3.8 installed.
In very first lines of code, you will see that: `path = ""`, this is where you paste your folder path. (folder, that contains .exe files, and configurations - not subfolders).

That's all. Anything else isn't required.
